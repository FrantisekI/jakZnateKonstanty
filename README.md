This is python-flask based web application for collecting user input. Information is stored in MySql dtatabase.

In version 2 most things are done on backend woth pytho, whereas in v3 i tried to get as much process to fronted JavaScript.


To run this your self first install requirements.txt, add environmental variables for database: HOST_FRAN="your host name" PASSWORD_FRAN="your password to db".
Than run V2/main.py or V3/main.py. 
Than the website should be accessible on 127.0.0.1

I am identifying people by their ip adress, I know there are better ways to not have one user to act as multiple, but I really wanted to get also the IP.
